Animal Stroop (adapted from Wright et al., 2003 by Nichelli, Scala, Vago, Riva, &
Bulgheroni, 2004). The task, based on the classic Stroop paradigm, consists of a series of animal figures (goose, sheep, cow
and pig) in which the congruency between the head and the body is manipulated and participants have to name the animal
based on its body. The test includes four experimental conditions, each comprising 24 stimuli: (1) incongruent condition: each
animal’s head is replaced by the head of one of the others; (2) congruent condition: the stimuli are the same as the prototypes
presented to the child during the training phase; (3) control shape (structural control) condition: the head is replaced with a
geometrical figure (a square, circle, or triangle); and (4) control face (semantic control) condition: the head is a caricature of
human faces. Participants are asked to name the animal that the body belongs to as quickly as possible. In each experimental
condition, the 24 stimuli are presented to the child in a notebook, each page containing 8 stimuli (which are balanced in
terms of which way the faces are oriented: 4 facing right and 4 facing left). The different conditions (congruent, control
shape, control face, incongruent) are presented to the participants in random order and the time taken to respond to the
stimuli on each page is timed using a stopwatch. In Stroop tasks, strong responses to cues have to be restrained in order to
produce a less dominant response. The total time, in seconds, taken to respond to all the stimuli within a given condition
(three pages) was considered as a dependent variable. The total number of errors per condition was also considered,
however, because the erroneous responses were included in the response times (RTs), as in all clinical versions of this task
(see Ludwig, Borella, Tettamanti, & de Ribaupierre, 2010).
An interference index, based on the differences between the incongruent and control face condition (see Nichelli et al.,
2004), was calculated on the RTs and errors. A higher score in the interference index thus implies a greater difficulty in
controlling the prepotent response in the incongruent condition, and a consequently less efficient inhibition.",0.42,"1",-1,"inhibition",0.0561555107210318,0.105304650544531

total number of words recalled) and two indices of susceptibility to interference, using the formula: (List 2 – List 1) and (List 3

All’ and ‘Forget All’, which differed only in the cue (remember or forget) that participants received after hearing the first half
of the list (the first 4 words). For each of the two conditions, the experimenter read the words at a rate of 3 s per word. The
inter-list cue was given after the fourth words. In the ‘Remember All’ condition, participants were told that the previous list
(apart from the first 4 words) should be remembered for the next test. In the ‘Forget All’ condition, after the first 4 words had
been presented, the experimenter pretended to have made a mistake and given the wrong instruction, so participants had to
try and forget the irrelevant list and concentrate on the upcoming relevant list. Following the inter-list cue, the second part of
the list was presented for the two conditions in the same way as for the previous words. After a 30-s interval during which
participants were asked to draw a sun or a moon (this task was planned specifically for individuals with DS), a recall test was
conducted for each condition, in which participants were asked to recall all the items in the two lists, regardless of which cue
had been presented before. Participants had 2 min to answer for each condition, but were given extra time when needed.

The ‘Design fluency’ task required participants to generate as many different patterns as possible. The child was asked to
draw as many different designs as possible in 1 min, each in a different box, by connecting dots using four straight lines (with
no line drawn in isolation). The total number of different patterns created for two different sets of dots was used as the design
fluency measure.
In the ‘Verbal fluency’ task, the instructions were to generate as many words as possible in 1 min. All words should start
with a certain letter in the letter fluency task. All words should belong to a certain category in the category fluency task. For
both tasks, the measure used was total number of correct responses.
To assess verbal switching, the ‘category fluency switching task’ from the Delis–Kaplan Battery was used. The task
required children to generate category exemplars from two different categories alternately – hence requiring shifting
between each category. Scores represented the total number of correct answers from both categories in 1 min.
Finally, the ID/ED task from the CANTAB (Cambridge Cognition, 2006) was used to assess non-verbal switching. The task
required the participant to choose one of two figures on a computer screen; each figure contained both relevant and
irrelevant features with respect to the choice to be made and the figures became more complex as the task went on (features
included shapes, lines, and colours). The only guidance as to which features were important for the correct choices came
from feedback after each response was given via the touch screen (i.e. whether the choice had been correct or incorrect).
Once a participant had made a series of correct choices, the choice ‘criteria’ were altered and the participant was required to
use the correct/incorrect feedback to switch strategy with respect to the features used to make his or her choices. Total
number of errors made was scored.",0.68,"13",1,"other",-0.273286130035068,0.0917577876007903

The Tower is a disk transfer task that provides a measure of
planning and problem solving efficiency that has been used in
studies of children with autism (Joseph, McGrath, & Tager-Flusberg,
2005). The Tower task requires the participant to rearrange a
set of disks from its original configuration on three pegs to reach
a goal state, shown on a picture board, in a prescribed number of
moves without violating the rules (e.g., moving only one ball at a
time from one peg to another). As the task progresses, the trials
become increasingly difficult and more complex. Only trials
solved in the requested number of moves and within the allotted
time period are scored as correct and awarded 1 point for a
possible score of 0 to 20. This total raw score was used as a
measure of planning and problem solving efficiency. The Tower
was designed for children ages 5 through 12 years. Although we
administered it to some participants who were below the chronological
age intended for this task (i.e., age 5 years), no floor effects
were observed in the typically developing group, with all but one
of the MA-matched typically developing peers demonstrating the
ability to understand and complete this subtest with success. Additionally,
it is important to note that a majority of these young
participants were only a few months younger than 5 years. Any

Modified Card Sorting Test (Nelson 1976)
The Modified Card Sorting Test (MCST) was proposed
by Nelson (1976) as a reduced version of the
Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (Berg 1948). In the
MCST, four stimulus cards are placed in front of
the child: the first card portrays a single red triangle,
the second card shows two green stars, the
third one, three yellow crosses and the fourth one,
four blue circles. Participants are required to match
each card according to colour, shape or number
with every consecutive card of a set of 48 response
cards, portraying all possible combinations of colour
(red, green, yellow, blue), shape (triangles, stars,
crosses, circles) or number (one to four). Participants
are informed if their choice is correct or not,
without, however, making suggestions regarding the
sorting criterion. After the participant had completed
six consecutive correct sorts (completion of a
‘category’), he or she was explicitly informed that
the sorting criterion had changed, with the phrase:
‘The rules have now changed. I want you to find
another rule’. The procedure continued until the
participant completed the three categories twice, or
until all 48 response cards were used.
The following parameters were recorded, according
to Cianchetti et al. (2007) and Temple et al.
(1996):
1 Categories completed. This criterion corresponds
to the number of sequences of six consecutive
correct matches the participant completes during
the test (minimum score 0, maximum score 6).
2 Percentage of responses that were correct.

The Tower of London (Shallice 1982) assesses
problem-solving and spatial planning. Instructions
for administration were taken from Sannio Fancello
et al. (2006).Test material consisted of a board,
13 cm ¥ 5 cm ¥ 1.5 cm, with three pegs of increasing
height (9.5 cm, 6.5 cm and 3.5 cm) and three balls
red, blue and green. The balls were 3 cm in diameter
with 1.3 cm diameter central hole. A5 (paper
size) coloured photographs of the target configurations
were provided. The child was asked to match
the target configuration, shown on a photograph,
from a standard start configuration by moving the
balls in accordance with set rules.The child had
three attempts to solve each problem. Problems
increased in difficulty from those which could be
performed in a minimum of three moves to problems
that could only be performed in a minimum
of seven moves. Each level of move had three different
problems, giving a total of 12 problems, altogether.
Participants were given a practice two-move
problem, in order to help them understand what
they had to do.The following scores were recorded:
the number of problems solved correctly (min 0,
max 12), the number of problems solved correctly
in the minimum number of moves (min 0, max 12)

Self-ordered Pointing Test – Temple et al. (1996)
In this task, which is an adaptation of a self-ordered
pointing task devised by Petrides & Milner (1982),
participants had to remember the sequence in
which they pointed to a set of visually displayed
stimuli by using their own strategies. Considering
the age, both mental and chronological, of the individuals
in the two groups, we decided to use only
one of two versions of the task proposed by Temple
et al. (1996): using the drawings of everyday objects.
The task is divided in four sections.The first part
consists of a set of six pages, on which an array of
six different drawings is printed. The actual drawings
are the same on each page, but they appear in
different spatial positions.The child is asked to
point to one drawing at a time, and to point to each
drawing only once. Therefore, each time a page is
turned, the child is required to remember which
drawings have already been pointed to, and to point
to a novel stimulus. Participants are open to determine
their own order of responding. The other sections
of the task are the same, except that they
contain 8, 10 and 12 stimuli, respectively, with the
corresponding number of pages. Scores were based
on the number of pages correctly completed (min 0, max 36), the number of times the same item was
pointed to in a set (item preservation) and the
number of repeated points made to the same spatial
position (position preservation). Overall, total scores
were obtained, as well as separate scores for each
set of stimuli.
Although this task is often used to assess sustained
attention (see, for example, Temple et al.
1996), we should note that it also involves a
memory component as a child has to hold in mind
all the pictures that s/he has already pointed to in
order to point to all the others.",0.53,"30",-1,"attention",-0.728795115787436,0.142185705346594

included three equal-length pegs spaced equidistantly on a board, and three
wooden disks of different sizes (small, medium, and large). Subjects were
instructed to move the disks, one at a time, on the three pegs so as to duplicate
a target configuration, while obeying the following rules: 1) placing a larger disk
on a smaller disk is forbidden, 2) only one disk may be moved at a time, and 3)
a disk must be on a peg or in the hand at all times. A practice problem, involving
two disks (small and large) and three moves, was given to the participants first.
It had to be solved before the participant was allowed to move to the three-disk
problems. If the participant was not able to solve the practice problem in three
attempts, no credit (0 points) was given and the task was discontinued.
The three-disk problems were arranged in a difficulty continuum with two- to
seven- move, tower-ending problems (cf. Borys et al., 1982; Klahr & Robinson,
1981; Spitz et al., 1982). Participants were allowed a maximum of six attempts
to solve each problem at each move-length. The criterion for credit was two
consecutive correct solutions, after which the participant was allowed to move to
the next move-length problem. Scoring was based on the number of trials needed
for a solution in the minimum number of moves in two consecutive trials.
Success on the first two attempts produced the maximum number of points (5).
Each additional attempt that was required decreased the subject’s score by 1
point. Since there were six sequence lengths (6 3 5 points), the TOH Score
ranged from 0 to 30.
A model of the target configuration was kept in view during the trials, and
each trial was interrupted if a rule violation occurred: Rule violations were
pointed out, the problem was discontinued, the initial configuration was returned
to, and the participant was asked to try to solve the problem again. If the optimal
number of moves was exceeded, the initial configuration was returned to and the
participant was asked to solve the problem in fewer moves. The number of the

set of errands in a shopping mall. The present study aimed to investigate the formulation rather than the execution of the plan; thus, the
task was modified into a pen-and-paper task. The participants were given a list of seven tasks to perform while following a series of rules.
The setting was a school environment, and the tasks included everyday school activities such as “drawing a sun”, “fetching a pen”,
“playing football” and “finding out what is for lunch”. The rules included finding the appropriate room to visit (e.g. go to the school
yard for playing football), not to enter the same room twice and doing the task in the appropriate order (e.g. fetching the pen
before drawing the sun). One point was given per correctly matched pair of rooms and tasks: 1.25 points were given if the tasks

in a zoo (e.g. the restaurant or the bears) using a paper map of the zoo. The participant may only use certain roads once and must
start and end in specified places. The participant is prompted to draw a line with a pen showing what places they visited and in
which order. The participant got one score per correctly visited animal. The score was then deducted by one each time the

IED set-shift paradigm
The IED is a two-choice computerized attentional set-shifting
paradigm, included in the CANTAB (Cambridge Cognition, 2002)
3
designed to assess the ability to learn stimulus–response mappings
and to switch to different stimulus–response mappings when a predetermined response criterion has been reached. On each trial, four
rectangular boxes appear on the computer screen that are aligned to
the top/bottom and to the left/right of the center (see Fig. 1). Two of
these boxes contain two abstract patterns, which are either purplefilled shapes and/or white lines (each representing a different stimulus dimension). Participants have to choose one of the two options
presented. Feedback is then provided on the correctness of their response by displaying a short ‘green-colored’ flash coupled with a
high-pitched tone when correct, and a ‘red-colored’ flash coupled
with a low-pitched tone when incorrect. After six consecutive correct responses, the response criterion is reached and the participant
proceeds to the next stage (without notification), with a maximum
of nine stages. The test ends after successful completion of the ninth
stage, or when a participant fails to reach criterion after the 50th
trial of any given stage. Duration of the IED is approximately 7-to10 min, depending on the performance of the participant. On every
trial, stimuli are cleared from the screen after 1500 ms, or upon a
touch–response provided by the participant. The inter-trial interval
was set at 1000 ms.
Fig. 1 displays a schematic drawing of the nine stages of the IED
together with an example of the response criterion associated with
each stage (marked by yellow squares). During the first stage, participants are presented with two patterns of a single dimension
(i.e., purple-filled shapes) and have to choose which one of these
two patterns is correct: simple discrimination (SD). During the second stage, stimuli remain the same, but now a reversal of the correctness of the stimuli is applied. That is, the previous incorrect
stimulus now is the correct response criterion: simple discrimination reversal (SD-R). At the third stage, stimuli from the other
dimension (white lines) are introduced and positioned next to
the relevant stimulus dimension (shape), but the correct response
criterion (i.e., shape) remains unchanged: compound discrimination (CD). During the fourth and fifth stages, the irrelevant dimension (i.e., white lines) is superimposed on the relevant dimension
(i.e., purple-filled shapes), with the white lines presented in the
foreground at all times. First, participants have to ignore the superimposed dimension and remain responding to same stimulus as
during the previous stage: compound discrimination imposed
(CD-I). Next, participants have to apply a reversal of stimulus–response mappings within the same stimulus dimension. That is,
the purple-filled shapes remain the correct dimension, only the
other stimulus type now is correct: compound discrimination
reversal (CD-R). At stage six, new stimuli are introduced for both
dimensions, while the dimension of these stimuli remains similar
(i.e., purple-filled shapes and white lines). Participants have to
switch responding to these new stimuli, but again to the stimuli
of the same dimension (purple-filled shapes) as during the previous stages: intra-dimensional set-shift (ID). At stage seven, a simple reversal within the same dimension (e.g., purple-filled shapes)
has to be applied: intra-dimensional shift reversal (ID-R). At stage
eight, new stimuli of the same dimension are again introduced: extra-dimensional set-shift (ED). Participants now have to switch
responding from the previous correct stimulus dimension (purple-filled shapes) to the new correct stimulus dimension (white
lines). At the ninth and final stage, participants have to apply a
simple reversal of stimulus–response mappings within the same
stimulus dimension of the previous stage (e.g., white lines): extra-dimensional reversal (ED-R).
The variables of interest in this study were the number of stages
completed successfully, the number of trials needed to reach criterion for each stage, and the errors committed at each stage. For the
scoring of errors, we defined the following error types (Barceló &
Knight, 1999; Barceló & Knight, 2002; Somsen, 2007; Somsen
et al., 2000): (1) ‘warning errors’. These error types were scored
separately, as they notify the participant of a change of the correct
criterion and cannot be anticipated. Warning errors were excluded
from the analysis; (2) ‘maintenance errors’. This error type should
reflect a failure to maintain responding according to the previous
learned criterion; (3) ‘discriminative errors’, a random error type;
and (4) ‘repetition errors’, defined as errors committed on trials

battery (Korkman, Kirk, & Kemp, 1998). Participants generated as many exemplars as possible from a given category within
60 s. Two trials were given, animals and food/drink. Overall number of correct responses and overall number of repeated
items were scored. Correct responses were items produced which belonged to the required semantic category and which had
not been previously given within the trial. For the animals trial, names of different breeds within the same species (e.g.
‘‘terrier, Rottweiler’’), different genders of the same animal (e.g. ‘‘cow, bull’’), names referring to the same animal at differing
stages of development (e.g. ‘‘dog, puppy’’); and easily recognisable mythical creatures (e.g. ‘‘Pegasus, unicorn, dragon’’) were
counted as correct. Similarly, distinct variants of the same core item (e.g. ‘‘lemon chicken, cashew chicken’’) and variants of
the same dish (e.g. ‘‘beef stew, chicken stew’’) were counted as correct responses on the food/drink trial, as were any distinct
brand names given (e.g. ‘‘Fosters, lager’’). Words which could feasibly be given for either category (e.g. ‘‘fish, chicken’’) were
counted as correct within each condition, provided they had not already been produced within that condition.
Repetitions constituted any generation of a previously given item. As well as items identical to those given previously,
these included pluralisations (e.g. ‘‘tiger, tigers’’), as well as diminutive terms (e.g. ‘‘pig, piggy’’) and previously generated
items preceded by an insufficiently differentiative adjective (e.g. ‘‘bear, big bear’’). The NEPSY-II Clinical and Interpretive
Manual reports high split-half reliability of r = 0.74, and a test–retest reliability of r = 0.77, for this task.",0.667,"99",1,"other",0.303459854958903,0.0810490839639219

The A-not-B task is a delayed-response
task that assesses executive function abilities, namely
working memory, inhibition and set shifting. Animal
lesion work demonstrates that this task depends on the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Diamond, 1990). The
task paradigm in the current study was based on work by
Espy, Kaufmann, McDiarmid and Glisky (1999). In this
task, the child watched the experimenter hide a small toy
in location A in a box, and then the experimenter placed
the box out of sight for a 10 s delay. The child was then
instructed to ‘Find the toy’. Once the child searched in
the correct location on two consecutive trials, the
contingency was reversed and the retrieval position was
switched to location B. Once the child searched in the
correct location on two consecutive trials the retrieval
position was switched back to location A, and so on. All
children received a total of 10 trials.
The dependent variables included an index of accuracy
when the rule stayed the same, which was calculated as
the number of trials in which the child correctly searched
as a proportion of the total number of ‘stay’ trials. In
addition, we also included an index of perseverative
responding on switch trials, which was calculated as the
number of trials where the child correctly searched in the
new location, as a proportion of the total number of
trials in which a post-switch error could have been made",0.471,"103",1,"inhibition",-0.517062510372206,0.0798972877578125
