## Renamed package
This package was recently submitted to CRAN under the name 'psychmetadata', but the name was requested to be modified to avoid confusion with the 'psychmeta' package. I am requesting that the 'psychmetadata' package be removed and to have the current package 'psymetadata' be its replacement. I apologize for troubles.
